The application will feature secure authentication through Next-Auth, allowing users to create accounts, recover passwords, and resend verification emails. We will use Zod and React Hook Form to validate forms, ensuring a seamless user experience. The editor, beautifully styled with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI, enables users to write and run code directly in the browser. Additionally, users can generate and share unique links to their code with others.
